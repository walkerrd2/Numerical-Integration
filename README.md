Implement Numerical Integration Methods: Develop Python functions to approximate definite integrals using three different numerical integration methods:

Composite Midpoint Method

Composite Trapezoid Method

Gaussian Quadrature Method

Test and Compare Methods: Test the implemented methods on specific integrals and compare their performance. This involves calculating the integrals for different numbers of subintervals or nodes and printing the approximated values.

Analyze Numerical Results: Evaluate the accuracy of the methods by comparing the approximated values to the exact values of the integrals. This helps in understanding the strengths and limitations of each method.

Report Writing: Document the process and results in a LaTeX report.

Overall, the project aims to provide hands-on experience with numerical integration techniques, enhance understanding of their implementation and accuracy, and improve skills in programming, error analysis, and technical reporting.
